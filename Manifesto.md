# Stop Hoarding. Start Mastering.

## The Reality: The "Read Later" Graveyard
Let’s be honest about your "Read Later" list. It is not a reading list; it is a graveyard of good intentions. You save articles because you care about ideas, but you rarely return to them.

Why? Because **reading to learn is hard work.**

It requires high energy in a low-energy world. When you stare at a 5,000-word essay after a long day, the friction is too high. So you switch tabs, and the "brain rot" sets in. You aren't lazy; you just lack the right leverage.

## The Science: Why "Guessing" Makes You a Better Reader
Cognitive science tells us something counter-intuitive: **The best way to start reading is to start guessing.**

This is called the "Pre-test Effect." When you try to predict the answer before you read the text, you aren't "cheating." You are priming your brain. You are opening a "knowledge gap" that your mind desperately wants to fill.

Guessing doesn't replace reading. It makes reading **stick**. It turns a passive activity into an active hunt for answers.

## The Solution: A Bicycle for Your Mind
We built a tool to help you pedal, not to drive for you. We use AI to transform static articles into an interactive challenge.

1.  **The Filter (Active Triage):** We present a quick, high-stakes scenario based on the article’s thesis.
    *   *If you solve it:* You intuitively understand the core concept. Archive the article with confidence. You just saved 20 minutes.
    *   *If you miss it:* You have proven to yourself that this is worth reading. Your curiosity is now online.

2.  **The Scaffold (Deep Dive):** For the articles that matter, we don't just dump text on you. We provide "scaffolding"—micro-predictions that guide you through the complex arguments. We help you deconstruct the author's logic so you can master it faster.

## The Promise: Respect for Your Attention
We are not here to sell you a shortcut. We are here to give you leverage.

*   **We don't dumb it down.** We don't summarize articles to replace reading; we gamify the entry point to wake up your brain.
*   **Read less, understand better.** You don't need to read *more*. You need the confidence to skip the noise and the tools to master the signal.
*   **Clear your tabs, kill the guilt.** Stop drowning in good intentions. Verify your intuition, archive with confidence, and finally stop hoarding.
